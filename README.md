## 🧠 How It Works

PhishGuard analyzes input using two layers:

- Detects suspicious keywords
- Checks URL structure anomalies
- Flags common phishing patterns

### 🔹 2. AI / ML Detection
- Machine-learning model trained on phishing indicators
- Outputs prediction + confidence score
- Combined with rule score for final verdict
